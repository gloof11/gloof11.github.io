# Welcome to the dev log!
<br />

This is my pet project that I want to complete by this summer.
I love the NES, and I love music, so why not put em together!

About a year ago I started making chiptune music again, and being inspired by [Ben Eater's 6502 series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnzuMJLZRdU&list=PLowKtXNTBypFbtuVMUVXNR0z1mu7dp7eH), I decided that I'm gonna give a shot at making an NES game.

However, I'm pretty shit at coming up with ideas for games, so I decided to settle for a music player.

As of right now the plan for the music player is this:
    * Only use the NES native soundchip (VRC6 can wait)
    * Want to run it on native hardware

Some extra features/projects I think would be a cool extension of this is:
    * Running NES games from an Arduino
    * Adding VRC6 support
    * Allowing for multiple cartridges (CD games where you had the game on multiple discs)

This is gonna be a fun experience in low level programming, and old hardware so join me!
